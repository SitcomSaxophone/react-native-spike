To start viewing the app you will need the Expo app on your mobile device. 

npm install 

open Expo app and create an account if needed

In the terminal type and enter: expo start

This should start the developer build. You should see a QR code that can be scanned with your mobile device when
logged into the Expo app. Scan the code and the application should start bundling. Once bundled 
the application should appear on the screen. 

Press the 'Start Timer' button and watch the 'magic' happen.
